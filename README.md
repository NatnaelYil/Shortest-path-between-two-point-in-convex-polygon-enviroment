# Shortest-path-between-two-point-in-convex-polygon-enviroment

This code finds a path between two points in a convex obstacle
environment by using A* search,computer algorithm that is widely used in pathfinding and graph traversal, the process of plotting an efficiently directed path between multiple points, called nodes. It enjoys widespread use due to its performance and accuracy.
This is done by determining the cost of the path to get to a node g(n) + the estimated distance to final destination-Heuristic
h(n).
